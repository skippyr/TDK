.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
A simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux that can be used to create general purpose terminal applications.

.PP

It uses byte oriented functions from the standard library for UTF-8 encoding support. Thus, all standard streams must be kept unoriented or under that same orientation. Do not use wide character functions.

.TP
.IP \\[bu]
It does not provide full resets of terminal properties. Do not manipulate them manually.

.SH RESERVED NAMES
