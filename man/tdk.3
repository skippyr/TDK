.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
A simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux that can be used to create general purpose terminal applications.

.PP
It includes features to manipulate terminal properties, styles and key readings with UTF-8 encoding.

.SH USAGE LIMITATIONS

This library has some limitations over its usage. To avoid conflicts and malfunctions, you must follow these rules:

.TP
.IP \\[bu]
It uses byte oriented functions from the standard library for UTF-8 encoding support. Thus, all standard streams must be kept unoriented or under that same orientation. Do not use wide character functions.

.TP
.IP \\[bu]
It does not provide full resets of terminal properties. Do not manipulate them manually.

.SH RESERVED NAMES
