.SH STANDARDS

.PP
C99, POSIX.1-2008

.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
A simple C99 terminal manipulation library for Linux that handles some terminal
properties, styles and trivial key readings with UTF-8 support.

.PP
In order to be kept small, it lacks proper parameter validation and resets. It
trust in its user to follow these rules:

.IP \\[bu]
The terminal properties can not be handled manually: including the use of
other manipulation functions or output of ANSI escape sequences.

.IP \\[bu]
The stdin stream must be kept oriented to wide-characters, while the stdout
and stderr streams, to single-characters.

.IP \\[bu]
All of its functions must be used as stated in their man pages.

.PP
For further details about its functions, check out their respective man pages.

.SH THREAD-SAFETY

.PP
Operations involving I/O are, by nature, non thread-safe, thus this library
neither.

.SH RESERVED NAMES

.PP
This library reserves names starting with "tdk_" and "TDK_" prefixed or not by
an underline to indicate implementation restrictions.
